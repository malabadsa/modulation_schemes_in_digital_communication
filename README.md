# modulation_schemes_in_digital_communication
QPSK and 16QAM modulations

This assignment is related to study the modulation techniques of digital communication systems in particularly QPSK and 16 QAM. The report studies the differences between both schemes and provide a comparision between them in term on BER and SNR.
